Set up your environment to extend a Python Flask application:

1 
2 
3 
4 

Once all the pre-requisites are completed, you can get started on developing endpoints to describe the application state.

## Exercise
Extend the Python Flask application with /status and /metrics endpoints, considering the following requirements:
- Both endpoints should return an HTTP 200 status code
- Both endpoints should return a JSON response e.g. {"user": "admin"}. (Note: the JSON response can be hardcoded at this stage)
- The /status endpoint should return a response similar to this example: result: OK - healthy
- The /metrics endpoint should return a response similar to this example: data: {UserCount: 140, UserCountActive: 23}
